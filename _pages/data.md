### Data

I am currently involved in two ongoing data collection processes:

- *Amakudata* (with Sayumi Miyano, Diana Stanescu, and Hikaru Yamagishi): A dataset of all former Japanese bureaucrats rehired in the private sector (i.e. revolving door appointments) from 2009 - 2019. 
- *Procurement* (with Hikaru Yamagishi): A dataset of all goods purchased from the private sector by the Japanese government from 2003 - 2018.

Each of these data sets will be made publicly available upon completion and validation.
