### Teaching Experience

My teaching experience consists of two semesters of teaching assistance for graduate-level courses in statistical methods and research design. These courses are: Foundations of Statistical Inference (taught by Professor Peter Aronow), and Design and Analysis of Randomized Field Experiments (taught by Professor Alexander Coppock). 

In addition to statistical methods and research design, I also hope to teach courses in substantive areas of political economy such as political corruption and market regulation.
