### Teaching Experience

My teaching experience consists of two semesters of teaching assistance for graduate-level courses in statistical methods and research design. These courses are: Foundations of Statistical Inference (taught by Professor [Peter Aronow](https://peteraronow.github.io)) and Design and Analysis of Randomized Field Experiments (taught by Professor [Alexander Coppock](https://alexandercoppock.com)). 

You can find some example lessons on various topics at the following links: [learning from random samples](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/random_samples.html); [summarizing random variables](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/random_variables.html); [the bootstrap, clustering, and introduction to regression](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/regression.html); [additional regression topics](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/regression2.html); and [research synthesis and meta-analysis](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/meta-analysis.html).

In addition to statistical methods and research design, I also hope to teach courses in substantive areas of political economy such as political corruption and market regulation.
