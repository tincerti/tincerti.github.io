### Data

I am currently involved in two ongoing data collection processes. Both data sets will be made publicly available upon completion and validation: 

- *Amakudata* (with Sayumi Miyano, Diana Stanescu, and Hikaru Yamagishi): A dataset of all Japanese bureaucrats who have retired to positions in the private sector (i.e. revolving door or "amakudari" appointments) from 2009 - 2019. While the full dataset is forthcoming, some preliminary descriptive statistics and data visualizations are presented at the following links:  
	- [Flows of bureaucrats from ministries to publicly traded companies by industry](https://www.trevorincerti.com/files/ministry_industry.html).
	- [Flows of bureaucrats from ministries to top public interest corporations](https://www.trevorincerti.com/files/public_interest_chord.jpeg).
	- [Flows of bureaucrats from ministries to top private sector corporations](https://www.trevorincerti.com/files/private_chord.jpeg).  

&nbsp;

- *Procurement* (with Hikaru Yamagishi): A dataset of all products procured from the private sector by the Japanese government from 2003 - 2018, including the agency or ministry which made the purchase, the company the product was purchased from, and the value of the contract.
