### Teaching Experience

My teaching experience consists of two semesters of teaching assistance for graduate level courses in statistical methods and research design. These courses are: [*Foundations of Statistical Inference*](http://www.trevorincerti.com/files/PL500-syllabus-2019.pdf) (taught by Professor [Peter Aronow](https://peteraronow.github.io)) and [*Design and Analysis of Randomized Field Experiments*](http://www.trevorincerti.com/files/PLSC_512_2020.pdf) (taught by Professor [Alexander Coppock](https://alexandercoppock.com)). You can find examples of some of my lessons below:  

*Foundations of Statistical Inference*:
  <details><summary>Lessons</summary><p>
- [Learning from random samples](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/random_samples.html)  
- [Summarizing random variables](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/random_variables.html)  
- [The bootstrap, clustering, and introduction to regression](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/regression.html)  
- [Additional regression topics](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/regression2.html)  
  </p></details>

*Design and Analysis of Randomized Field Experiments*:
  <details><summary>Lessons</summary><p>
- [Introduction to dplyr, potential outcomes, and random assignment](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/intro.html)  
- [Research synthesis and meta-analysis](https://www.trevorincerti.com/teaching/meta-analysis.html).  
  </p></details>

In addition to statistical methods and research design, I also hope to teach courses in substantive areas of political economy such as political corruption and market regulation.
