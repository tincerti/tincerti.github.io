Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Economy at the University of Amsterdam. 

My main area of research is in comparative political economy, and broadly examines economic drivers of political behavior. This includes topics such as money in politics, business-government relations, corruption, interest group influence, and collective action. Much of my work focuses on East Asia, particularly Japan, and I am a current co-organizer of the [Asian Politics Online Seminar Series](https://aposs.cc). I also conduct research in quantitative methods, where I am particularly interested in the reliability and validity of measurement strategies. My research is published or forthcoming in the *American Political Science Review*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Journal of Politics*, and *Political Analysis*, among other outlets. It has received coverage by media such as *The Economist*, *The New Yorker*, and *The Washington Post*.

I received my Ph.D. from Yale University (2022) and B.A. from UC Berkeley (2012), and was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University. Before graduate school, I worked as a Data Scientist at TrueCar and as an economic consultant at Compass Lexecon.

I typically use field experiments or original data collection and observational econometrics in my research.

  
 Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard University Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, where I am an affiliate of the [Program on U.S.-Japan Relations](https://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/us-japan) and the [Research Cluster on Business & Government](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/wrc22-business-and-government).

My research focuses on extraction of private gain from politics and public office, such as electoral punishment of corruption, regulatory capture by firms and interest groups, and award of contracts to firms with political connections. A second area of research looks at the economic drivers of political behavior more generally.
