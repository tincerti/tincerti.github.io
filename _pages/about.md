Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Harvard University Weatherhead Center for International Affairs. 

My research focuses on extraction of private gain from politics and public office, such as electoral punishment of corruption, regulatory capture by firms and interest groups, and award of contracts to firms with political connections. A second area of research looks at the economic drivers of political behavior more generally.

I typically use field experiments or original data collection and observational econometrics in my research. I have also conducted research in quantitative methods, where I am particularly interested in the reliability and validity of measurement strategies. My research has been published in the *American Political Science Review* and *British Journal of Political Science*, among other outlets. 

I received my Ph.D. from Yale University (2022) and B.A. from UC Berkeley (2012), and previously worked as a Data Scientist at TrueCar and as an economic consultant at Compass Lexecon.
