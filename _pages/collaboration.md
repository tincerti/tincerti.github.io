### Collaboration

I believe science is improved by collaboration with researchers with diverse backgrounds and expertise, and am extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with the following individuals. I encourage you to check out their websites and engage with each of their exciting research agendas. I also always welcome new connections and opportunities for collaboration with researchers, NGOs, government, and the private sector, so please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
