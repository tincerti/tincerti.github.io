Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in comparative political economy at Yale University. My research primarily focuses on business influence in politics, with particular emphasis on regulation, corruption, and energy policy. I am also interested in the application and development of data science tools and methods of causal inference in political economy research. 

Prior to Yale, I worked as a Data Scientist for TrueCar, Inc., where I developed forecasting models to predict automotive residual values and sales volumes in the US and Canada. Before that, I analyzed economic regulatory matters that raised risks of antitrust violations as an economic consultant at Compass Lexecon.
