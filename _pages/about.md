Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Candidate at Yale University. 

My research follows two related streams in political economy. The main stream is extraction of private gain from politics and public office, such as electoral punishment of corruption, regulatory capture by firms and interest groups, and award of contracts to firms with political connections. A second stream looks at the economic drivers of political behavior more generally. I have a regional specialization in Japan and East Asia, but examine these research areas across countries wherever they are salient. 

I typically use field experiments or original data collection and observational econometrics in my research. I have also conducted research in quantitative methods, where I am particularly interested in the reliability and validity of measurement strategies, as well as improving accessibility to applied researchers and practitioners. My research has been published in the *American Political Science Review* and *British Journal of Political Science*, among other outlets. 

Prior to Yale, I worked as a Data Scientist for TrueCar, Inc., where I developed forecasting models to predict automotive residual values and sales volumes in the US and Canada. Before that, I analyzed regulatory matters that raised risks of antitrust violations as an economic consultant at Compass Lexecon.
