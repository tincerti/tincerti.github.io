Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Economy at the University of Amsterdam. During Spring 2025, I am Visiting Assistant Professor in Modern and Contemporary Japanese Politics at Georgetown University. 

My primary area of research is in comparative political economy, with a focus on the role of money in politics and business influence in politics. Additionally, I explore how economic stimuli shape political behavior and preferences. Much of my work focuses on East Asia, particularly Japan. I also conduct research in quantitative methods, where I am particularly interested in the reliability and validity of measurement strategies. My research is published in the *American Journal of Political Science*, *American Political Science Review*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Journal of Politics*, and *Political Analysis*, among other outlets. It has received coverage by media such as *The Economist*, *Het Financieele Dagblad*, *The New Yorker*, and *The Washington Post*. 

I am also an Expert at the Leiden Asia Centre and was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University. I received my Ph.D. from Yale University and B.A. from UC Berkeley. Before graduate school, I worked as a Data Scientist and in economic consulting.

 Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard University Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, where I am an affiliate of the [Program on U.S.-Japan Relations](https://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/us-japan) and the [Research Cluster on Business & Government](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/wrc22-business-and-government).

My research focuses on extraction of private gain from politics and public office, such as electoral punishment of corruption, regulatory capture by firms and interest groups, and award of contracts to firms with political connections. A second area of research looks at the economic drivers of political behavior more generally.
