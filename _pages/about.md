Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in comparative political economy at Yale University. My research focuses primarily on the use of political office for private or corporate gain, with an emphasis on regulation, corruption, and energy policy. I am also interested in the use of data science tools and methods of causal inference in political economy research. 

Prior to Yale, I worked as a Data Scientist for TrueCar, Inc., where I developed forecasting models to predict automotive residual values and sales volumes in the US and Canada. Before that, I analyzed  regulatory matters that raised risks of antitrust violations as an economic consultant at Compass Lexecon.
